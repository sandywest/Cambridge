for Dream Island. It features 12 returning contestants from BFDI, along with 10 new contestants (6 are the recommended characters from the 1st season), which were voted onto the show by the viewers. Also, unlike the last season, the show is hosted by 3 different hosts, they are TV, Puffball Speaker Box and Firey Speaker Box, instead of the Announcer, who hosted Season 1, but it was actually revealed in BFB 29 that the Announcer had been hosting BFDIA this whole time. (TV was following Announcer's orders and the Puffball Announcer Speaker Box was a creation by the Announcer).

However, BFDIA 6 has been officially cancelled, along with the rest of the season, marking it the first, and currently only, BFDI season to be cancelled. In canon, this was because the budget ran out since the Announcer had to purchase a Hand Powered Hand Powered Recovery Center Creator after the Hand Powered Recovery Center Teardrop won as a prize was destroyed by Evil Leafy.

This was later replaced with a third season, known as IDFB, which was aired on September 1st, 2016, within the release of "Welcome Back", so far its only episode.

Overview

This season involved 22 inanimate objects (12 veterans, 10 newbies) that were voted by the viewers to compete for Dream Island, which despite declaring a winner last season, still doesn't have an owner. The contestants are divided up into 2 teams, and before a contest, players may switch teams if they want to. Contests are chosen by spinning a wheel, and the winning team gets immunity, while the losing team is up for elimination. The viewers vote by rating (liking/disliking) contestants' videos. The contestant with the most likes on his/her video can spin a wheel, and receive a prize depending on when the wheel stops, while the contestant who has the most dislikes on his/her video is eliminated and sent to the Tiny Loser Chamber, which is itself located in the Locker of Losers.

Leafy, Bubble, and Flower would've competed, that is, if they were alive/present at the voting results. However, they weren't, meaning they would not join.
Despite not joining, TV still became the host of the season.

    Even if they did get enough votes to join, Woody and Nonexisty would not be eligible to compete because they were dead/non-existent at the time of the voting results.

Recommended characters

Recommending a character is slightly different from last season. Instead of simply recommending a character in the comments section of a video, you recommend one on a Google rating system (similar to YouTube's rating system). At the end of the voting period (1st through 10th of every month), the 25 recommended characters with the most likes would be featured in the following episode. Copyrighted characters and people are not allowed to be recommended.

The link no longer works because Google Moderator has been shut down and redirects to a 404 page on bfdi.tv.
Battle for Dream Island - Season 2 (All Episodes)

On December 15, 2018, between the releases of "What Do You Think of Roleplay?" and "Return of the Rocket Ship", the jacknjellify channel uploaded an official, one-hour-and-22-minute video compiling every episode of the second season, with black title cards marking the start of a new episode. On the old thumbnail, the word "2" was shown, and Coiny and Ruby's assets were normal.

Trivia

    Leafy, Bubble, Flower, Pen, Blocky, David, Woody, Snowball, and Eraser did not qualify for this season.
    This is the only season of BFDI that has the viewers pick the entire cast of contestants who get to compete.
    Rocky was the most voted contestant to join this season.
    This is the first and only season of BFDI that doesn't require voting with YouTube comments. Viewers instead voted by rating the contestants' videos.
    This season has 22 contestants, which is one more than the previous season.
        Initially, it would be 23 contestants later due to the prize of B.A.G.U.E.T.T.E. being to choose a recommended character to join BFDIA, but B.A.G.U.E.T.T.E. was cancelled and replaced with Ten Words of Wisdom.
    This is the first and so far only season that has every elimination decided by the viewers.
    Of the 12 returning contestants, 5 were originally on the Squishy Cherries, and 7 were originally on the Squashy Grapes. Every member of Another Name also returns.
    There are 11 boys and 11 girls each in BFDIA.
        The returning contestants are 7 girls and 5 boys, but the new contestants are 6 boys and 4 girls.
        All the returning male contestants competed on Another Name except for Spongy.
        If Flower, Bubble, and Leafy were present, every season one female would've competed in this season.
    So far, this is the only season TV has hosted, until Puffball got her speaker box and Firey used his speaker box when Pin killed Puffball's.
    The episode titles so far, except "Insectophobe's Nightmare 3", are said by a character within the respective episode. Puffball said "Yeah, who? I wanna know!" (12 times), Fries said "Get digging" (5 times), Firey said "How about Zeeky Boogy Doog!", Pencil said "Shut up and get in the van!", Nickel said "No more snow!", Pencil said "Oh my god, it's a monster!" and, once more, Pencil said "The long-lost Yoyle City!".
    Rocky and Bracelety had the highest and lowest amounts of votes to join (Rocky had 1,008, Bracelety had 18). Coincidentally, both had the digit 1 as the first digit, and 8 as the last digit.
    All 5 armless contestants from Season 1 (Golf Ball, Ice Cube, Rocky, Spongy, and Tennis Ball) competed in season 2, along with Nickel, Yellow Face, and Puffball for a total of 8 armless contestants.
        It will be 9 if one also counts Pin.
    This season used to have the longest episode: Episode 5a (17 minutes).
        This has been surpassed with "Getting Teardrop to Talk" (26 minutes), with many more episodes ever since surpassing that.
            However, if BFDIA 5 is counted as one episode, then this season will still have the longest episode.
    This is the first season with uneven teams. TPOT became the second when Teardrop joined in "The Worst Day of Black Hole's Life" as a team made up of her alone.
    This is the only season that allows the contestants to switch teams.
    Episodes no longer follow the previous pattern of being released on the 1st of every month, as many delays happened.
    Golf Ball was originally not going to be in BFDIA, but she was chosen by InternPony707.
        This also goes for Gelatin. He was not up for voting, but was chosen by DeGrassiFan.
        Book, Yellow Face and Puffball were also not going to be in it either, but due to the absence of Leafy, Bubble and Flower, they ended up joining.
    BFDIA used to be the shortest Battle for Dream Island season, having only 5 episodes at the time (9 if you count all Episode 5 parts).
        This is succeeded by the third BFDI season, IDFB, which has, so far, a total of 1.
    Match and Pencil seem to be playing Spongy Cake in the intro.
    This is the first and only season to have the first eliminated contestant in the season that isn't a female (Donut). In BFDI, Flower was the first to be eliminated, in BFB, it's Pencil, and in TPOT, it's Pie.
    Donut is the only male eliminated contestant in BFDIA.
    This is the only season so far that doesn’t have a Squishy Cherry as it’s lowest ranking BFDI contestant.
    Just like Season 1, it had a coincidental message with the same pattern as used in Season 1, which says: "Don’t try that thing again". Coincidentally, they never did it again, because the hidden message in Season 4 is nothing.
    Michael released the BFDIA files as a response to braveman30's question about when the BFDIA and IDFB files will be released.[1]
    On December 15, 2018, a compilation of all released BFDIA episodes was uploaded by jacknjellify.
    This is the first season to not have a merge as it was cancelled before it could reach that point.
    The last team up for elimination was Team No-Name.
    FreeSmart is the only team in BFDI history to never be up for elimination, although this is because the season ended before they could lose.
    Dora is the only contestant who didn't die in this season.
    This is the first season in which Bubble is not the first contestant to die. In this case, it's Yellow Face. In addition, it is the first time someone doesn't die on the first episode.
    This is the only season that allowed a select number of recommended characters to appear at a time, being twenty-five.
    Despite "Return of the Hand Glider" having less than 1000 votes, this season was still produced.
    As of June 26, 2022, BFDIA is the only season where all of its episodes have at least ten million views on YouTube (excluding the BFDIA 5b announcement video). Coincidentally, that was three days before this season became 10 years old.
    This is the first and only season where Rocky's team didn't place 2nd in the first contest.
    The official reason BFDIA was cancelled is because Michael's AdSense account was terminated.
        The reason in IDFB 1 is that Ruby forgot to remove the lens cap.
        The reason in BFB 29 is that Announcer didn't have any more savings to keep the show running.

WARNING! Carry on reading, or your soul will be taken, even if you read the word "warning"! There once was a man named Duke Hunapon. He was lazy, and very uncaring. He always wore a jacket, no matter how warm it was outside. He had an older brother named Michael who always bossed him around. One day, Michael was killed, and it affected Duke greatly. He went insane and started murdering people. Soon, he got into a fight with someone and got killed. Now, he roams around as a tall skeleton with a red shirt, and the exact same hoodie that Duke wore. This skeleton was known as "Swapfell Papyrus", and he will kill you if you don't post this on 15 comment sections of any website before your bedtime. If you fail, and you wake up when he's in your room, your death will be slow and very painful. A girl named Lily Lilupanin read this, and didn't listen. She was (EEE) and killed in her sleep. If you copy and paste this on 15 comment sections of any website before your bedtime, Swapfell Papyrus will make sure you feel safe."
